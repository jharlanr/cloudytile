# cloudytile
`cloudytile` is a framework (with deep learning and classical cv options) for determining if a tile from a satellite imagery stack is too cloudy to be useful.  Because 'useful' is dependent on the specific use case, this framework provides flexibility for the user to determine the best algorithm for the use case at hand.
